# StrictlyCSharpProjects-
This repository only contains thoroughly completed C# applications to be reviewed upon.  
## ATM-CSharp Focus: 
ATMs are simple and easy to use banking terminals that we use in our daily lives. In this project I was able to define problems that go along inside an atm, traversing through the atm logics and managed to accomplish a functioning ATM console app
## WPF TicTacToe Focus: 
Using Windows Presentation Foundation, I managed to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game (also known as "Noughts and Crosses" or "Xs and Os" in C# using WPF). I implimented animations to make the final product a bit more appealing. The code is written in C# but the game logic and overall design of the game can also be used in other programming languages like Java and C++.
