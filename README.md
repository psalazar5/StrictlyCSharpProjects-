# StrictlyCSharpProjects

This repository showcases a collection of meticulously crafted C# applications, ready for thorough review. Each application demonstrates my proficiency in C# programming and showcases my ability to create robust and functional software solutions. I invite employers to explore these projects as a testament to my skills and dedication as a C# developer. 

## ATM-CSharp Focus: 
ATMs are simple and easy to use banking terminals that we use in our daily lives. In this project I was able to define problems that go along inside an atm, traversing through the atm logics and managed to accomplish a functioning ATM console app

## WPF TicTacToe Focus: 
Using Windows Presentation Foundation, I managed to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game (also known as "Noughts and Crosses" or "Xs and Os" in C# using WPF). I implimented animations to make the final product a bit more appealing. The code is written in C# but the game logic and overall design of the game can also be used in other programming languages like Java and C++.

## Acronym Generator Console App Focus: 
Using simple techniques to better understand strings. This acronym generator can make you an acronym, give it a try! 

## Random Password Generator Focus: 
Everyone needs great and secure passwords so we don't get hacked right? Well to address this I completed an app that generates a randomized password from lengths 5 to 20 characters long.

## Console Based Accounting System Focus: 
Implemented a primitive accounting system in C# as an object-oriented console application. The program includes checking and premium account classes with functionalities like setting starting balance, depositing money, calculating interest, printing account details, and transferring funds between accounts. The program executes a predefined set of operations and outputs the account balances and interest. Optional features include user input for account management and inheritance for code reusability. The project aims to apply learned C# concepts effectively.

## BackGround-Generator Focus: 
In this project, I implemented a C# console application called "backgroundChanger" that allows users to set their desktop wallpaper to a random image from a predefined folder. The program uses the `SystemParametersInfo` function from the `user32.dll` library to change the wallpaper, providing parameters like `SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER`, `SPIF_UPDATEINFILE`, and `SPIF_SENDCHANGE`. The code selects a random image from the folder and updates the desktop wallpaper accordingly. This project demonstrates my ability to use C# interop with Windows APIs and showcases my skills in working with files and user profiles.
- Interoperability (interop) refers to the ability of different software systems or technologies to work together and communicate seamlessly. It allows applications from different platforms or programming languages to interact and share data, enabling efficient collaboration and integration across diverse environments. Interop is crucial for building robust and flexible software solutions that can leverage the strengths of various technologies and achieve smooth interactions between them.
